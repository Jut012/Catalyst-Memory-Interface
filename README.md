# Catalyst Memory Interface
## Overview

The Catalyst Memory Interface is a custom memory allocation system designed to improve memory efficiency and performance in applications with varied allocation and deallocation needs. This project offers a flexible approach to memory management, reducing fragmentation and making better use of available memory.

## Features
* **Optimized Memory Allocation**: Uses efficient methods for allocating and deallocating memory to enhance speed and responsiveness.
* **Reduced Fragmentation**: Actively manages memory segments to keep fragmentation low, ensuring consistent performance even as memory demands change.
* **Robust Error Handling**: Built-in safeguards protect against common allocation errors, making the system more stable and reliable.
